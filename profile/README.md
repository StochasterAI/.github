Being assortments of mathematical brillinace and bright programming, Artificial Neural Networks are [algorithms from THE BOOK](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Proofs_from_THE_BOOK)

We believe in spreading the beauty of ANNs in two ways:

1. Stochaster Framework for Neural Networks. Stochaster allows you to learn neural networks by creating them, tweaking them and expanding their capabilities.
2. Stochaster Lectures on Neural Networks. These lectures cover ANNs in various levels of depth and complexity with full explanations on the underlying mathematics.
