Being an assortment of mathematical brillinace and bright programming concepts, Artificial Neural Networks are [algorithms from THE BOOK](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Proofs_from_THE_BOOK)

We believe in spreading the beauty of ANNs in two ways:

1. Stochaster Framework for Neural Networks. Stochaster allows you to learn neural networks by creating them, tweaking them and expanding their capabilities. This is for you if you've [unsuccessfully] reverse-engineered things as a kid!
2. Stochaster Lectures on Neural Netoworks. These lectures cover ANNs in various levels of depth and complexity with complete explanations on the underlying mathematics.
