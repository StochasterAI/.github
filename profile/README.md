Being assortments of mathematical brillinace and bright programming, Artificial Neural Networks are [algorithms from THE BOOK](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Proofs_from_THE_BOOK).

We maintain two main repos:
1. **Stochaster Framework for Neural Networks**. Stochaster allows you to study neural networks by creating them, tweaking them and expanding their capabilities.
   - This framework is developed to provide a thorough understanding on NNs both while using them in your code, or reading our source-code. More technical info available in the [Stochaster Repo](https://github.com/StochasterAI/Stochaster).
2. **Stochaster Lectures on Neural Networks**. These lectures cover ANNs in various levels of depth and complexity with full explanations on the underlying mathematics.
   - Lectures contain PyTorch models followed by ground-up implementations on them used on example datasets (such as MNIST), and dive deep into their linear algebra and calculus and cover more advanced model-specific domains if needed (such as graph theory in GNNs).

Finally, this is our [email](mailto:stochaster.ai@gmail.com).
